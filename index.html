					<h1>Virtual Drawing Board</h1>

					<h4 style="display: inline-block;width: 58%;vertical-align: middle;padding-right: 2%">
						Virtual Drawing Board allows us to write on the screen of laptops as if we are writing on a piece of paper and this doesn't even require the laptop to be touchscreen!<br>
						The main idea behind the project was that not everyone has iPads and most of the PCs today are not tochscreen. Due to this whenever we have to write using freehand like in online interviews or presentations we have to use mouse or mousepads which is not very convenient.<br>
						It uses a simple torch to write on the screen and can be very useful in presentations etc. Accurate and robust algorithm which can draw at high speeds without any considerable time lags. Pointer follows torch with very high precision almost instantly.<br>
						Coded many commands mapped to keys on keyboard which assist in drawing. No restriction on distance and angle between torch and computer for comfortable writing experience. Robust against almost all lighting conditions.

					<h1>Biography Generation</h1>
					<h3>Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning</h3>
					<h4>
						Biography Generation is a research project I am currently involoved in. The main idea behind this project is to automate the process of creating a wikipedia page for a person.<br>
						The main goal of the project is to develop a Biography Generation system which can generates biography (similar to a wikipedia page) for a person, given considerable amount of text resources related to him/her.<br>
						Apart from generating a meaningful biography of the person we intend to make it capable to detect if a piece of information is false and should not be included in the biography.
