				My name is Ayush Garg and currently I am pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar. I have gained experience in various fields of computer science which includes Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Web Development. I love to do research on the topics involving Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Image Processing as much as I enjoy to develop software based on these fields. I am passionate about working in these fields. I love to gain knowlegde on these fields and do projects using them in my free time.

					<h1>Biography Generation</h1>
					<h3>Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning</h3>
					<h4>
						Biography Generation is a research project I am currently involoved in. The main idea behind this project is to automate the process of creating a wikipedia page for a person.<br>
						The main goal of the project is to develop a Biography Generation system which can generates biography (similar to a wikipedia page) for a person, given considerable amount of text resources related to him/her.<br>
						Apart from generating a meaningful biography of the person we intend to make it capable to detect if a piece of information is false and should not be included in the biography.

					<h1>License Plate Recognition</h1>
					<h3>Computer Vision and Image Processing</h3>
					<h4>
						License plate recognition as the name suggests recognizes the license number of a car from its image.<br>
						It given any image of front or rear of the car localizes the license plate in the image and outputs the license number of the car. 
						Accurate and robust algorithms for localizing license plate and segmentation.<br>
						The system is robust to the lighting, environment and other stuff which might affect the image and localizes the license plate and the numbers in it very accurately.

					<h1>Ask Quesitons - Django based website</h1>
					<h3>Full Stack Web Development</h3>
					<h4>
						Ask Questions is a fully functional Question and Answer website built using django (python), html, css, javascript.<br>
						This is a dynamic website has almost all the functionalities which regular QnA sites have and even more. This project was intended as a ready to launch product, therefore a lot of effort has been put in the Front End/User Interface part apart from the efforts for the Back End part which provides the website its functionalities.<br>
						Please visit the GitHub page of the project to know detailed descriptions of the functionalities of the website.
